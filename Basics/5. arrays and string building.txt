//an Array is a collection of something, a class (we'll come back to that), a string, a number
//what makes them convenient is that you don't need a variable name for each thing in the array, just the array itself
//arrays are created as follows:
int[]/*datatype + []*/ integerArray /*array name*/ = new int[32]; /*= new datatype[number of spots in the array]*/
//the above line creates an array with 32 empty spots, indexed(their place in the array) 0 to 31
//to fill the array with something we can use a for loop
for (int i = 0; i < integerArray.Length/*array name.length tells the program how long the array is*/; i++)
{
    integerArray[i]/*array name[some number] tells the program "this is spot some number, in the array" */ = i; 
}
//now try using console.writeline to print out the contents of the array using a for loop




//strings can be treated as arrays of characters in some programming languages, including c#
//strings and characters can also be added togther to create larger strings
string string1 = "hello ";
string string2 = "world!";
string string3 = string1 + string2;
Console.WriteLine(string3);
//try flipping the flipMe string, and store the result in flippedString
string flipMe = "I am a string";
string flippedString = string.Empty;
for (int i = flipMe.Length-1; i >=0 ; i--) //read this carefully
{
    
}
Console.WriteLine(flippedString);
